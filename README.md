# DS2438

Arduino Library for the DS2438 1-wire battery monitor.

#### Note

Started with this library, however I could not find these sensors for sale.
It is shared for future reference.


## Description

The DS2438 is a **very experimental** library for the DS2438 battery management sensor.

The library is not tested yet as I have no hardware (hard to get).
So for the moment the library is written based upon the datasheet 
and provided as is.

The device supports the following functionality.
- voltage measurement
- temperature measurement
- current measurement.
- 40 bytes non-volatile EEPROM memory
- Elapsed time meter in binary format

This library supports only one DS2438 per Arduino / MCU pin.

As always, feedback is welcome.


#### Hardware pins

Need to find a breakout.

See datasheet for details

## Interface

```cpp
#include "DS2438.h"
```

#### Constructor

- **DS2438(OneWire \* ow)** constructor needs a reference to OneWire object.
- **bool begin(uint8_t retries = 3)** resets oneWire.
Returns true if address / device is found and all is OK. 
There will be a number of retries to connect, default 3.
- **bool isConnected(uint8_t retries = 3)** Returns true if address / device is found.
There will be a number of retries to connect, default 3.


#### Temperature and voltage

- **float readTemperature()** read temperature from device. Degrees Celsius.
- **float getTemperature()** get the last read temperature.
- **bool readVoltage(uint8_t channel)** read voltage from device. Volts.
- **float getVoltage(uint8_t channel)** get the last read voltage.


#### Current

- **void setResistor(float resistor = 0.01)** set the shunt resistor in OHM.
This allows a sort of tuning/calibration.
- **void enableCurrentMeasurement()** set IAD bit, see datasheet.
Starts the background measurement of the current.
Takes ~28 milliseconds for a measurement.
Must be called before readCurrent will work.
- **void disableCurrentMeasurement()** clear IAD bit, see datasheet.
Stops the background measurement of the current.
- **float readCurrent()** read current from device.
- **float getCurrent()** get last read current.


#### Current Offset

See datasheet for details.
units not clear yet.

- **void writeCurrentOffset(int value)** 
- **int readCurrentOffset()**

#### Threshold

See datasheet for details.

- **void writeThreshold(uint8_t value)**
- **uint8_t readThreshold()**

only 4 values possible.

|  value  |  THRESHOLD       |
|:-------:|:----------------:|
|  0x00   |  None (default)  |
|  0x40   |  ±2 LSB          |
|  0x80   |  ±4 LSB          |
|  0xC0   |  ±8 LSB          |


#### Time

From datasheet:

The elapsed time meter (ETM) is a 4-byte binary counter with 1-second resolution. 
The ETM can accumulate 136 years of seconds before rolling over. 
Time/date is represented by the number of seconds since a reference point, which is determined by the user. 
For example, 12:00 A.M., January 1, 1970 could be used as a reference point.

- **void writeElapsedTimeMeter(uint32_t value)** value in seconds.
- **uint32_t readElapsedTimeMeter()** returns current time in seconds.


#### EEPROM

Valid addresses are 0..39.

- **bool writeEEPROM(uint8_t address, uint8_t value)** write a byte to EEPROM address.
- **uint8_t readEEPROM(uint8_t address)** read the byte from EEPROM address.


#### Configuration register

See datasheet for details.

- **void setConfigBit(uint8_t bit)**
- **void clearConfigBit(uint8_t bit)**
- **uint8_t getConfigByte()**


## Operation

This library supports only one DS2438 per Arduino / MCU pin.


## Future

#### Must

- Improve documentation (a lot).
- test with hardware or simulator?.
- examples for testing.


#### Should

only after testing and 0.1.0 code works.

- implement Disconnect timestamp
- implement End of charge timestamp
- implement Integrated Current Accumulator (ICA).
- implement Charging Current Accumulator (CCA).
- implement Discharging Current Accumulator (DCA).


#### Could

only after testing and 0.1.0 code works.

- unit tests?
  - possible?
- async interface for both T and V.
- optimize the code.
  - cache registers?
- improve magic masks and numbers
- performance test.
- getAddress() ?
- debug and error handling.
- copy snapshot to EEPROM(page)
  - copies page 0 to EEPROM page 0..4
